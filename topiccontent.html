                    <span>Introduction</span>  <br>
                    Diabetes is a healthcare condition that has continued to affect so many people,  <br>
                    both young and old. Understanding more about Diabetes will help people live a healthy
                     lifestyle by avoiding all the possible things that might cause it. In this assignment, <br>
                      I will assess why Diabetes is a significant health issue to individuals and the world. 
                       I will discuss the background of Diabetes, its definitions, and the types of Diabetes. 
                        Besides, I will discuss what is needed to promote individual and group health for people
                         who have Diabetes. By the end of the assignment, one will have better knowledge about <br>
                          Diabetes since I will also discuss the causes and preventive measures that can be
                           undertaken to prevent the disease. Towards the end of the assignment, I will describe 
                            three achievable health promotion goals, hence helping fight against Diabetes. 
                             I will also describe some of the interventions and roles that different people, 
                              groups, and organizations play to reduce the high cases of Diabetes in the world. <br> <br> 
                    
                    <span>Background</span> <br>
                    
                    During the medieval ages, being diagnosed with Diabetes was like a death sentence.
                     The pioneers of diabetes treatment were Thomas Willis, Sushruta, and Arataeus (Mandal, 2021). <br>
                      The three were Greek physicians who encouraged people to exercise on horsebacks 
                      to prevent excess urination. They also described other therapies like overfeeding <br>
                       and taking wine to reduce starvation and excessive loss of fluids (Mandal, 2021).
                        On the other hand, the ancient Indians would test for Diabetes by taking ants near  <br>
                        a person’s urine. If the human urine attracted the ants, then the person would be
                         diagnosed with urine (Mandal, 2021). Diabetes is a disease that is the leading <br>
                          cause of high blood sugar levels. People who have Diabetes have bodies that cannot
                           make enough insulin, or their bodies cannot use the insulin they have effectively (Healthline, 2021).  <br>
                           Insulin is the hormone that moves sugars from the blood to the body cells. There are several types of Diabetes, <br>
                            including type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, gestational diabetes, prediabetes, and Diabetes insipidus (Healthine, <br>
                             2021). All these types affect our bodies differently, and they all have different effects,
                              hence different coping strategies.

                    PLACE AN ORDER
                    The rationale for Choosing Diabetes
                    
                    Diabetes is among the most severe health issues in the world. This is the reason why I chose to discuss it to
                     create awareness about it. The bad thing with Diabetes is that one can get it and not know that they have it. <br>
                      By the time they realize that they have Diabetes, the condition is worse, and the person is highly affected. <br> 
                      According to Genesis Medical Associates (2015), one out of 
                      three adults have higher blood sugar levels; a condition referred to as prediabetes.
                       If the persons do not change their lifestyles, the sugar levels increase, leading to other types of Diabetes
                        (Genesis Medical Associates, 2015). Learning about Diabetes will allow people to support each other in <br> 
                         the fight against Diabetes. This includes eating healthy meals and maintaining a healthy lifestyle through 
                         exercising (Dowshen, 2021). Another reason why I chose to discuss Diabetes is to learn more about
                          the causes and how to manage the disease. Since most people do not know about the condition, it is 
                          crucial to educate them so that in case they feel any symptoms, and they can get the treatment as early <br> 
                           as possible (Dowshen, 2021). It is easy to deal with Diabetes as long as the signs are detected early enough 
                           and the patient follows the given guidelines on healthy living. <br> <br> 
                    
                    <span>Epidemiology</span> <br> 
                    
                    Diabetes is a significant health concern since it affects so many people in the world. Diabetes can affect any  <br>
                    person. However, some ethnic groups are affected more than others. The Alaska Natives and the American Indians  <br>
                    are more affected by Diabetes as compared to all other ethnic groups. In terms of age, more than  <br>
                    sixty-five years are more prone to getting diabetes than young people. According to Shaikh (2021), % of the
                     people who are more than 65 years have diabetes. However, the young people are also affected but at a meager <br>
                     percentage compared to the older people.
                    
                    The risk factors for Type 1 diabetes are hereditary, hence easily transferred from parents to children. <br>
                     Type 1 diabetes primarily affects young children and teenagers. Also, white Americans are at a higher <br>
                      risk of getting the disease than African Americans and Latino Americans (Shaikh, 2021). Type 2 diabetes 
                    affects middle and old age persons. Also, other risk factors for type 2 diabetes include genes, being overweight, <br>
                     a history of gestational pregnancy, and giving birth to a baby that is more than 9lbs (Shaikh, 2021). <br>
                    
                    It is important to note that diabetes is more prone in rural areas where people do not have access to health
                     services and education. In the United Kingdom, 28% of the people with diabetes have issues obtaining medication  <br>
                     due to a lack of health services and knowledge on how to go about diabetes treatment (Whicher et al., 2019 p.243).
                      Besides, most of the people who are in the rural do not go for annual health checkups; hence their conditions get  <br>
                      worse daily. <br> <br> 
                    
                    <span>Assessment and assessment tools for Diabetes</span> <br> 
                    
                    Different tools are used during the assessment of diabetes. Assessing diabetes <br>
                     is very important as it helps differentiate between different types of diabetes and the <br>
                      extent of the condition. The Diabetes Prevention Screening Tool helps identify the persons at  <br>
                      risk of getting diabetes (Diabetes Education Services, 2021). Such people are encouraged to join  <br>
                      the CDC prevention program. There is also the Risk Test for Pre Diabetes patients to understand the <br>
                       risks they face as pre-diabetics (Diabetes Education Services, 2021). <br>
                    
                    The Diabetes Risk calculator is a tool that is used to detect undiagnosed diabetes and prediabetes. <br>
                     The social Support Assessment Tool helps diabetic patients to have a support system (Diabetes Initiative, 2020). <br>
                      Patients who have Diabetes need a lot of support from family and friends. The support shown will  <br>
                      help them adhere to the doctor’s instructions, hence improving the chances of being better. Another <br>
                       assessment is the Mental Health Progress Report. The report is filled up during the patient’s follow-up visits. <br>
                        The assessment involves questions determining if the patient is affected by the condition mentally  <br>
                        (Diabetes Initiative, 2020). It helps the doctors to guide the patient on how they can cope mentally with Diabetes. <br>
